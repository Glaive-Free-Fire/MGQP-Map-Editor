# MGQP Map Editor
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.2.10-blue)

A simple, browser-based, single-file HTML tool designed for **bilingual editing and translation** of in-game dialogue from `MapXXX.txt` files. It provides a user-friendly interface for translators to edit text while respecting character limits and complex formatting tags.

This tool is built to be used offline, running entirely in your web browser without needing a server or internet connection.

## ‚ú® Features (v1.2.10)

-   **Bilingual Side-by-Side View:** Load an original Japanese map file to display the original text above each dialogue box for easy reference.
    -   **Advanced Initial Mapping:** The script automatically performs an initial synchronization by matching dialogue segments between named speakers.
    -   **Manual Sync Correction:** An **"–î–æ–ø –°—Ç—Ä–æ–∫–∞"** (Extra Line) button appears on dialogue lines, allowing you to manually push the Japanese original text down to the next available slot. This gives you full control to fix synchronization issues caused by splitting lines.
-   **Load Local Files:** Load `MapXXX.txt` files directly from your computer into the browser.
-   **Automatic Dialogue Extraction:** Scans the file and extracts only the `ShowText(["..."])` commands for editing, ignoring all other script logic.
-   **Live Character Counter:** Each text box displays a real-time count of "in-game" characters.
    -   Ignores invisible control codes like `@@n` (newline).
    -   Ignores character name tags (e.g., `<@@C[6]Name@@C[0]>`).
    -   Ignores special quote symbols (`@`).
-   **Visual Limit Warning:** Text areas automatically turn **red** if the visible character count exceeds the 50-character limit.
-   **Corrupted Tag Detection:** Automatically highlights text areas in **red** if a character name tag is broken or syntactically incorrect, preventing game-breaking errors.
-   **Advanced Line Splitting:** A **`+`** button appears for long lines to split them. This feature supports two distinct modes:
    -   **Remainder Mode:** (Default) Fills the first line up to the 50-character limit and moves only the remaining words to the new line.
    -   **Equal Mode:** Splits the text into two lines of roughly equal length, which is useful for balancing dialogue.
-   **Wrap Mode Toggle:** A new button in the UI allows you to easily switch between "Remainder" and "Equal" splitting modes.
-   **Empty Line Deletion:** A **`-`** button appears for empty text areas, allowing for easy cleanup of redundant dialogue boxes.
-   **Undo/Redo Support:** Full history support with `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` and on-screen buttons.
-   **Correct Saving of Split Lines:** Saves your changes into a new `.txt` file. Lines split with the `+` button are correctly saved as new, separate `ShowText` commands in the output file.
-   **Copy Utility:** A button to copy all extracted text blocks to the clipboard for use in other tools.

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  Download the `.html` file of this editor.
2.  Open the file in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
3.  Click the **"1. –ó–∞–≥—Ä—É–∑–∏—Ç—å —Ñ–∞–π–ª –¥–ª—è –ø–µ—Ä–µ–≤–æ–¥–∞"** button and select the map file you wish to edit.
4.  (Optional but recommended) Click the **"2. –ó–∞–≥—Ä—É–∑–∏—Ç—å —è–ø–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π —Ñ–∞–π–ª"** button and select the original Japanese map file.
5.  The editor will display the text for editing. If the Japanese file was loaded, the original text will appear above corresponding dialogue blocks.
6.  Edit the text in the text areas as needed. If synchronization is off, use the "–î–æ–ø –°—Ç—Ä–æ–∫–∞" button to adjust it.
7.  When you are finished, click the **"–°–∫–∞—á–∞—Ç—å –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω—ë–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Ñ–∞–π–ª"** button to save your work.

## UI Guide

-   **Red Background:** This indicates an error in the text area. It means one of two things:
    1.  The in-game character count is **over 50**.
    2.  The character name tag (e.g., `<@@C[6]...`) is **broken or incomplete**. You must fix the tag syntax to remove the red highlight.
-   **Japanese Original Text:** A non-editable gray box that appears above a translation field when a Japanese source file is loaded. This text is selectable for easy copying.
-   **"–î–æ–ø –°—Ç—Ä–æ–∫–∞" (Extra Line) Button:** This button appears on dialogue lines that have Japanese text above them. If your translation takes up an extra line and pushes the synchronization off, click this button to move the Japanese text down to the next available line.
-   **Character Counter:** Shows `–ò–≥—Ä–æ–≤—ã—Ö —Å–∏–º–≤–æ–ª–æ–≤: ##`. This is the final character count that will appear in the game.
-   **`+` Button:** Appears only when the character count is over 50. Click it to intelligently split the line according to the currently selected Wrap Mode.
-   **`-` Button:** Appears only when a text area is completely empty. Click it to remove that `ShowText` command from the file.
-   **Wrap Mode Button:** Located in the top-right corner. Click it to toggle the behavior of the `+` button between "Remainder Split" and "Equal Split".

## Technical Details

-   The tool is designed to parse text files containing RPG Maker-style event commands.
-   It specifically finds and isolates lines matching the `ShowText(["..."])` pattern.
-   For safe in-browser editing, it internally converts all backslash (`\`) control characters into at-symbols (`@`) and restores them perfectly upon saving.
-   Features a segment-based mapping algorithm for initial text synchronization and provides manual controls for fine-tuning.
