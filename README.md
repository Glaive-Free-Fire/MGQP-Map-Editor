# MGQP Map Editor
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.2.50-blue)

A simple, browser-based, single-file HTML tool designed for **bilingual editing and translation** of in-game dialogue and other text commands from `MapXXX.txt` files. It provides a user-friendly interface for translators to edit text while respecting character limits and complex formatting tags.

This tool is built to be used offline, running entirely in your web browser without needing a server or internet connection.

## ‚ú® Features (v1.2.50)

-   **Expanded Command Parsing:** Automatically extracts not just `ShowText`, but also other key commands for a more complete translation workflow:
    -   `Display Name` (–ò–º–µ–Ω–∞ –ª–æ–∫–∞—Ü–∏–π)
    -   `ShowChoices` (–í–∞—Ä–∏–∞–Ω—Ç—ã –≤—ã–±–æ—Ä–∞)
    -   `When` (–¢–µ–∫—Å—Ç, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π –æ—Ç–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –ø—Ä–∏ –≤—ã–±–æ—Ä–µ)
    -   `Script` & `ScriptMore` (—Ä–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ç–∏—Ä—É–µ–º—ã–µ —Å–∫—Ä–∏–ø—Ç–æ–≤—ã–µ –∫–æ–º–∞–Ω–¥—ã)
-   **Advanced Bilingual Synchronization:** The core feature for comparing translation with the original.
    -   **Intelligent Initial Mapping:** The script performs a sophisticated initial sync, matching not only dialogue with/without names but also other command types like `ShowChoices`.
    -   **Manual Sync Correction:** An **"–î–æ–ø –°—Ç—Ä–æ–∫–∞"** (Extra Line) button provides manual control to fix any synchronization errors by pushing the Japanese text to the next available slot.
    -   **Missing Translation Alerts:** If the Japanese file contains text that is missing in the translation file, the editor will automatically insert a **"–¢–†–ï–ë–£–ï–¢–°–Ø –ü–ï–†–ï–í–û–î"** (TRANSLATION REQUIRED) placeholder block, ensuring no lines are missed.
-   **Live Character Counter:** Each text box displays a real-time count of "in-game" characters. For non-dialogue lines, it shows a simple character count.
    -   Ignores invisible control codes like `‚àæ‚àæ` (newline).
    -   Ignores character name tags (e.g., `<‚àæ‚àæC[6]Name‚àæ‚àæC[0]>`).
    -   Ignores special quote symbols (`‚àæ`).
-   **Visual Limit Warning & Error Detection:** Text areas automatically turn **red** if:
    -   The visible character count exceeds the 50-character limit.
    -   A character name tag is broken or syntactically incorrect.
-   **Advanced Line Splitting (`+` button):** Supports two modes for splitting long dialogue lines, toggled by the "Wrap Mode" button:
    -   **Remainder Mode:** (Default) Fills the first line to the 50-character limit and moves only the remainder to the next line.
    -   **Equal Mode:** Splits the text into two lines of roughly equal length.
-   **UI & Usability Features:**
    -   **Hide/Show Scripts Button:** Allows hiding `Script` blocks to focus only on translatable text.
    -   **Empty Line Deletion (`-` button):** Easily remove unneeded `ShowText` commands.
    -   **Full Undo/Redo Support:** `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` and on-screen buttons for all actions.
-   **Structure-Aware Saving:** The save function correctly handles all edited block types, including new lines created by splitting, preserving the file's integrity.
-   **Dynamic Filename:** The saved file is automatically named based on the original file (e.g., `Map001.txt` becomes `Map001_edited.txt`).

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  Download the `.html` file of this editor.
2.  Open the file in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
3.  Click the **"1. –ó–∞–≥—Ä—É–∑–∏—Ç—å —Ñ–∞–π–ª –¥–ª—è –ø–µ—Ä–µ–≤–æ–¥–∞"** button and select the map file you wish to edit.
4.  (Optional but recommended) Click the **"2. –ó–∞–≥—Ä—É–∑–∏—Ç—å —è–ø–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π —Ñ–∞–π–ª"** button and select the original Japanese map file.
5.  The editor will display the text for editing. Use the **"–°–∫—Ä—ã—Ç—å –°–∫—Ä–∏–ø—Ç—ã"** button to focus on dialogue.
6.  Edit the text as needed. If synchronization is off, use the **"–î–æ–ø –°—Ç—Ä–æ–∫–∞"** button to adjust it.
7.  When you are finished, click the **"–°–∫–∞—á–∞—Ç—å –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω—ë–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Ñ–∞–π–ª"** button to save your work.

## UI Guide

-   **Red Background:** Indicates an error in a dialogue box (over 50 characters or a broken name tag).
-   **Japanese Original Text:** A non-editable gray box above a translation field for reference. Selectable for copying.
-   **"–î–æ–ø –°—Ç—Ä–æ–∫–∞" (Extra Line) Button:** Appears on dialogue lines with a Japanese original. Click to push the Japanese text down to the next available slot, fixing sync issues.
-   **`+` Button:** Appears on long dialogue lines. Splits the line according to the selected Wrap Mode.
-   **`-` Button:** Appears on empty text areas for easy deletion.
-   **Wrap/Script Mode Buttons:** Located in the top-right corner for quick access to toggles.

## Technical Details

-   The tool parses text files for RPG Maker event commands like `ShowText`, `DisplayName`, `ShowChoices`, `When`, and `Script`.
-   For safe editing, it internally converts backslash (`\`) control characters to a temporary symbol (`‚àæ`) and restores them on save.
-   Features a segment-based mapping algorithm for initial text synchronization and provides manual controls for fine-tuning.
